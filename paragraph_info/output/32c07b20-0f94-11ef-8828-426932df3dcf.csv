4,"complexity, chatgpt, text, trained, manual, annotations, annotators","ChatGPT outperforms crowd-workers for several annotation tasks, including relevance, stance, topics, and frame detection . Across the four datasets, the zero-shot accuracy of chatGPT surpasses that of crowdworkers by about 25 percentage points on average . The per-annotation cost of"
6,"nlp, labeled, data, training, set","NLP applications require high-quality labeled data, notably to train classifiers or evaluate performance of unsupervised models . For example, researchers often aim to filter noisy social media data for relevance, assign texts to different topics or conceptual categories, or measure their sentiment or stance . Until recently, two main strategies were"
10,"mechanical, turk, trained, crowd-workers, amazon, quality, annotators","trained annotators create a relatively small gold-standard dataset . Crowd workers are a much cheaper option, but the quality may be insufficient, particularly for complex tasks and languages other than English ."
11,"sets, large, training, language, models, chatgpt","This paper explores the potential of large language models for text annotation tasks . It demonstrates that zero-shot ChatGPT classifications outperform MTurk annotations, at a fraction of the cost . The results demonstrate their potential to transform how researchers conduct data annotations ."
13,"content, tweet, moderation, chatgpt",We use four datasets including tweets and news articles that we collected and annotated manually for a previous study on content moderation . We relied on trained annotators to construct a gold standard for six conceptual categories .
18,"computation, parameter, temperature, value, chatgpt","For ChatGPT, we conducted four sets of annotations . For MTurk, we aimed to select high-quality crowd-workers . We then performed these exact same classifications with chatGPT ."
19,"zero-shot, accuracy, intercoder, performance, agreement","Across the four datasets, we report ChatGPT's zero-shot performance for two different metrics: accuracy and intercoder agreement . Accuracy is measured as the percentage of correct annotations . Intercodingr agreement is computed as the percent of tweets assigned the same label by two different annotators "
22,"content, tweets, relevance, moderation, task, chatgpt",ChatGPT performed much better than MTurk in the second task but struggled with misclassifying tweets about specific user suspensions in the relevance task .
23,"accuracy, agreement, chatgpt, intercoder","On average, intercoder agreement is about 56% for MTurk, 79% for trained annotators, 91% for ChatGPT with temperature = 1 . This suggests that a lower temperature value may be preferable for annotation tasks ."
24,"of, chatgpt, trained, intercoder, agreement, annotators","ChatGPT's accuracy is positively correlated with the intercoder agreement of trained annotators, suggesting better performance for easier tasks . MTurk's outperformance is negatively correlated, suggesting stronger overperformance for more complex tasks."
27,"comparison, llm, labeling, text-annotation","The evidence is consistent across different types of texts and time periods . It strongly suggests that ChatGPT may already be a superior approach compared to crowd-annotations on platforms such as MTurk . At the very least, the findings demonstrate the importance of studying the text-annotation properties and capabilities of LLM"
33,"lexisnexis, learning, classifier, training, dataset, set, machine","Sample size was determined by the number of texts needed to build a training set for a machine learning classifier . The fourth dataset replicated the data collection for , but for January 2023. It includes a random sample of 500 tweets drawn from a dataset of 1.3 million tweets."

39,"mturk, trained, human, annotator, chatgpt","MTurk workers performed the same set of tasks as trained annotators and ChatGPT . To ensure annotation quality, we restricted access to the tasks to workers classified as ""MTursk Masters"" by Amazon ."
41,"of, annotation, mturk, the, crowd-workers, quality, instruction, chatgpt","We used the ChatGPT API with the 'gpt-3.5-turbo' The annotations were conducted between March 9-20 and April 27-May 4, 2023 . After testing several variations, we decided to feed tweets one by one to chatGPT using the following prompt ."
46,"correct, accuracy, average, intercoder, predictions, agreement",intercoder agreement refers to the percentage of instances for which both annotators report the same class . we computed average accuracy .
