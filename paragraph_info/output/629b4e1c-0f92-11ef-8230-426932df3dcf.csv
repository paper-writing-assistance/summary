In fact, it is SO effective that it would now be considered foolhardy not to use supervised pretraining .","image, perception, classification, visual"
6,the ImageNet dataset is the de facto pretraining dataset . There are studies analyzing the effects of various ImageNet pretraining factors on transfer learning or the use of different datasets that are of the same size magnitude magnitude as ImageNet .,"imagenet, transfer, dataset, learning"

22,The hashtag set sizes are measured after merging the hashtags into their canonical forms . We hypothesize that the first set has a visual distribution similar to IN-1k . The other two represent more general visual distributions covering fine-grained visual categories .,"instagram, distribution, data, visual"
23,5% of the images in the val-CUB-6k200 set also appear in train-IN-1M-1k . 1.78% of images in VAL-IN-50k-1k set are in the JFT-300M training set . We compute R-MAC features for all candidate images using a,"deduplication, features, training, image, r-mac"
26,"Our datasets have two nice properties: public visibility and simplicity . To see what it looks like, the images are browsable by hashtag at https : 1 . Our data is also taken from the ""wild"" .","brownbear, public, visibility"
28,"despite our efforts to make the dataset content transparent, we acknowledge that, similar to JFT-300M, it is not possible for other research groups to know exactly which images we used nor to download them en masse .

66,"In-1k, networks pretrained on the target-taskaligned 1.5k hashtags outperform those trained using a larger hashtag vocabulary .

76,"we only train the final linear classifier on the target task, because full finetuning may mask the damage caused by pretraining noise . The results suggest that networks are resilient against label noise: a noise level of p = 10% leads to a loss of less than 1% in classification accuracy .","pretraining, noise, label"
77,Prior studies in language modeling found that resampling Zipfian distributions reduces the impact of the head of the word distribution on the overall training loss . We perform experiments in which we evaluate three different types of data sampling in the Instagram pretraining .,"imagenet, hashtag, instagram, sampling, square-root"
80,resampling of hashtag distribution is important in order to obtain good transfer to ImageNet image-classification tasks . using uniform or square-root sampling leads to an accuracy improvement of 5 to 6% irrespective of the number of ImageNet classes in the transfer task .,"image-classification, imagenet, hashtag, distribution, vocabularies"

The second trend comes from comparing COCO's default AP metric .","model, large, precision, coco, pretraining, average, data, capacity"
100,"We observe that the improvement over IN1k, 5k pretraining from IG-1B-1k is much larger in terms of AP@50 .
